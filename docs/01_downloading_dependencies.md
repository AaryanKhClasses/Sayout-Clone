# Sayout - Clone
### Welcome to the full-on tutorial guide on how you can make an anonymous messaging service by yourself!

### In the last page, we initiated the project. Now, we will download the dependencies.

---

## Downloading Dependencies:
### Run the following command in the terminal to download the dependencies:
```sh
$ npm i express mongoose typescript
```

### 1. `Express:` Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### 2. `Mongoose`: Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

### 3. `Typescript`: Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

---

## Devdependencies:
### Devdependencies are dependencies that are only used during development.
### To download these, run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
$ npm i -D @types/express nodemon
```

### 1. `@types/express`: TypeScript definitions for Express.
### 2. `nodemon`: A Node.js monitor that automatically restarts your Node.js server when files change.
